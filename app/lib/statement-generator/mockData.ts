      "While deployed to Iraq in 2003, I witnessed an IED explosion that severely injured members of my unit. The incident occurred during a routine patrol near Baghdad. I was approximately 50 meters away when the explosion happened, and I helped evacuate the wounded. Since then, I've experienced recurring nightmares, heightened anxiety, and difficulty sleeping. The sounds of loud noises or backfiring cars trigger intense anxiety and flashbacks to the incident."

    statement:
      "I am writing to provide additional information regarding my service-connected back injury. The injury occurred during training exercises in 2001 when I fell from an obstacle course. Since then, my condition has progressively worsened, significantly limiting my ability to work and perform daily activities. I experience constant pain that radiates down my left leg, and I am unable to sit or stand for extended periods. This has affected my ability to maintain full-time employment, as I require frequent breaks and position changes throughout the day. I am currently receiving physical therapy twice weekly and taking prescribed pain medication, but my condition continues to impact my quality of life substantially."
