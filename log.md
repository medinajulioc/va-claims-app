# VA Claims App - Implementation Log

## BDOC Dashboard Implementation

1. Cloned the Shadcn UI Kit Dashboard repository to use as a reference
2. Created the `/bdoc` route structure:
   - Created `app/bdoc/layout.tsx` with a layout similar to the dashboard layout
   - Created `app/bdoc/page.tsx` with a simple dashboard interface with tabs
3. Updated the `generateMeta` function in `lib/utils.ts` to handle the `/bdoc` route correctly
4. Used existing components:
   - Tabs, TabsContent, TabsList, TabsTrigger from @/components/ui/tabs
   - CustomDateRangePicker from @/components/custom-date-range-picker
   - Button from @/components/ui/button

The BDOC dashboard provides a similar interface to the main dashboard but is focused on VA Benefits Documentation. It includes:

- A main header with a title and date picker
- Three tabs: Overview, Documents, and Claims
- Placeholder content for each tab section

The implementation reuses existing components and follows the same structure as the main dashboard for consistency.
