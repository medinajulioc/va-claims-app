## October 5, 2024 - Enhanced Community Post Creation Interface

### Changes

1. **Improved Attachment Button**:

   - Replaced the "Add Image" button with a more streamlined paperclip icon button
   - Changed button styling from `variant="outline"` to `variant="ghost"` for a cleaner look
   - Updated dialog title from "Upload Image" to "Upload File" to reflect broader file attachment capabilities
   - Added proper screen reader text with `<span className="sr-only">Attach File</span>` for accessibility
   - Made similar updates to the New Post page for consistency across all posting interfaces

2. **Enhanced Input Field Design**:
   - Updated the post input field to use a rounded-full border for a more modern appearance
   - Added subtle focus states with `focus:shadow-sm` and `focus-visible:ring-1` for better user feedback
   - Made the input field more visually integrated with its button
   - Improved the overall spacing and visual hierarchy of the component
   - Ensured proper responsive behavior on different screen sizes

These improvements create a more polished, user-friendly interface that aligns with modern design patterns. The paperclip icon is a universally recognized symbol for attachments, making the functionality more intuitive. The cleaner input field design reduces visual clutter while improving usability.
