## 2024-07-03: Implemented Condition Logger Phases 5-12

Today I implemented several new features for the Condition Logger functionality:

### Phase 5: Pre-filled Templates and Quick Log Shortcuts

- Templates were already defined in `/lib/templates.ts` with mild, moderate, and severe options for each condition
- The `DynamicForm` component already had quick log buttons for these templates

### Phase 6: Flare-Up Alerts

- Flare-up criteria were already defined in the conditions data
- Enhanced the alert display with proper styling and accessibility attributes

### Phase 7: VA Claims Progress Tracker

- Created a new `ClaimsTracker` component that allows users to:
  - Add key dates in their VA claims process
  - View a timeline of claim events
  - Store claim events in localStorage for persistence

### Phase 8: Voice-to-Text Logging

- Added speech recognition to the `DynamicForm` component
- Implemented voice command parsing for:
  - Setting severity levels ("severity 7")
  - Setting dates ("today", "yesterday")
  - Adding notes ("notes feeling pain in lower back")
  - Setting duration ("duration 3 hours")
  - Using templates ("mild", "moderate", "severe")
  - Submitting the form ("submit", "save log")

### Phase 9: Multi-Condition Correlation

- Created a new `CorrelationView` component that:
  - Identifies days when multiple conditions were active
  - Finds common condition pairs
  - Shows severity levels for correlated conditions
  - Helps users identify potential relationships between conditions

### Phase 10: Offline Mode

- Implemented localStorage for all data persistence:
  - Condition logs
  - Claims timeline events
  - User preferences

### Phase 11: Mood and Lifestyle Tracking

- Extended condition fields to include:
  - Mood selection (Happy, Neutral, Anxious, etc.)
  - Sleep hours tracking
  - Stress level tracking

### Phase 12: Accessibility and Usability Enhancements

- Added ARIA attributes to all form fields:
  - aria-describedby for field descriptions
  - aria-required for required fields
  - aria-valuemin/aria-valuemax for number inputs
  - aria-label for buttons and controls
- Improved UI organization with tabbed interface:
  - Logger tab for symptom logging
  - Analytics tab for progress tracking and correlation analysis
  - Claims tab for VA claims timeline

The LogTable component already had good performance optimization features including:

- Pagination for handling large log sets
