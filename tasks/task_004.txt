# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement JWT Authentication System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Create secure JWT-based authentication with login, registration, and session management
# Details:
Implement JWT token generation, validation, and refresh mechanisms. Create API routes for user registration and login. Set up secure password hashing with bcrypt. Implement middleware for protected routes. Create authentication hooks for client components. Configure secure cookie storage for tokens.

# Test Strategy:
Test user registration with validation. Verify login functionality and token generation. Test protected route access with and without valid tokens. Ensure token refresh works correctly. Verify secure logout functionality.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Configure Clerk Authentication [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up Clerk for user authentication with ID.me, Login.gov, email, Apple, and Google SSO options
### Details:
Integrate Clerk authentication provider with Next.js, configure SSO options including ID.me and Login.gov for veterans, implement secure login/logout flows, and handle authentication redirects. Set up the necessary Clerk API keys and endpoints.

## 2. Implement OAuth 2.0 for VA.gov API [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Set up OAuth 2.0 authentication for accessing VA.gov API with secure token storage
### Details:
Implement OAuth 2.0 flow for VA.gov API authorization, securely store tokens in Supabase Postgres (production only), handle token refresh and expiration, and create proper error handling for authorization failures.

## 3. Develop JWT Token Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Create JWT generation, validation, and handling for authentication and API access
### Details:
Implement JWT token generation with bcryptjs for password hashing, create token validation middleware for protected routes, handle token refresh logic, and ensure proper security measures including token expiration and secure storage.

## 4. Create Protected Routes and Authentication Guards [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.3
### Description: Implement route protection and authentication guards for secure access control
### Details:
Set up middleware for protecting routes that require authentication, implement redirect logic for unauthenticated users, create session validation mechanisms, and integrate with the role-based access control system.

## 5. Implement Local Development Bypass [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.3
### Description: Create mock authentication sessions and bypass for local development environment
### Details:
Set up environment detection for local development, implement mock sessions and authentication bypass in auth.mock.ts, create a "Development Mode" badge for the bottom-right corner of the UI, and ensure seamless switching between local and production authentication.

## 6. Implement Authentication Error Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4
### Description: Create robust error handling for authentication failures and edge cases
### Details:
Implement comprehensive error handling for authentication failures, create user-friendly error messages, add logging for auth-related issues, handle edge cases like token expiration during active sessions, and implement proper fallback mechanisms.
